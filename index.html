<p><p>also I watched the first 3 episodes of doctor who on dvd, and then I put in the second disc and holy shit it stutters way too much, and I’m 80% sure the disc is scratched or something, so I’ve been watching it on Apple TV, which SUCKS ASS BY THE WAY, because if you have other doctor who seasons and other stuff that isn’t classic/original gets funneled into season 99??? just completely not in chronological order at ALL, and there’s some other that are not in season 99 but you have to search and search just to find Season 1, episode 1, “rose” and even then they are all spread out so it’s just easier to search for doctor who on Apple TV and find the correct one in chronological order then go through the library. in conclusion, Apple TV sucks ass and if you don’t have to, then don’t use it, it’s cool, I like it, but I’ve been rambling for too long and need to wrap this up, so uh yeah it just frustrates me that they absolutely FUMBLED so hard it’s unbelievable. still a good series though. </p>
